## Testimonial Card

#### Skills Used

- React
- Tailwind CSS

#### Things Learned

- text-ellipsis – Works only when combined with overflow-hidden.

- figure & figcaption – Wrapping an image inside a figure and using figcaption for accompanying information (like name, handle) gives semantic meaning. Example: a profile card with an avatar.

- whitespace-nowrap – Prevents text from wrapping to the next line.

- **[ring in Tailwind](https://www.charlievuong.com/demystifing-tailwind-borders-outlines-and-rings)** – Understand the differences between ring, border, and outline`.

- line-clamp-<number> – Limits text to a set number of lines and adds … if the text overflows.

- `space` vs `gap` – space works on non-flex layouts; gap works only on flex or grid layouts.
